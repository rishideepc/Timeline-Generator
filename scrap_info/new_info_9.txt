More Info: Mohammed Siraj took the perfect revenge after being hit for consecutive boundaries by West Indies opener Shai Hope in the first ODI at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Sunday. The right-arm seamer, who bowled a maiden in the first over of the match, was hit for two cracking fours through the off-side by Hope in the second and third delivery of his next over but Siraj, instead of being demoralised, got the ball to nip back from outside the off stump in the next delivery and induced an error from Hope. The right-hander once again went for a drive but this time, the movement off the pitch brought about his downfall. As Hope is often guilty of leaving a gap between his bat and pad, the ball took the inside half of his bat and cannoned into the stumps. India got their first wicket after opting to bowl first as Hope went back for 8.
